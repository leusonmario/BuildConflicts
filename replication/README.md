# Study Replication

We encourage and support replications of our study. For that, our scripts are available on <a href="https://github.com/leusonmario/TravisAnalysis/tree/emse" target="_blank" > GitHub</a>.
Assuming the disponibility of GitHub and Travis CI services, replications can be done using the sample we analyzed in our study, as also a new one. To run the analysis, it is required access to a valid GitHub and Travis CI account. Additional information to start to use Travis CI using a GitHub account can be found in the project page previously reported.

Our project page has additional information to support and run your replication. 
In case of any problems or questions, please contact us.

Here, you can also find and download our results (csv files):
